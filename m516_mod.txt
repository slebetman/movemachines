Modified m516
=============

Instruction formats:

goto:
  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 |_|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
  1           address

	Since the majority of literals are used by the pc anyway, why not
	optimise it? The goto instruction has exactly the same semantics as:

	  pc lit LABEL

	except that goto can only work on the first 32k of memory. Jumping
	to anywhere in the upper 32k still requires regular literals.


16 bit instruction:
  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 |_ _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _|
  0 0      dest          src

	Same as the original m516.


packed instruction:
  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 |_ _ _|_|_ _ _|_ _ _|_ _ _|_ _ _|
  0 1 0    dest  src   dest  src

	The packed instruction now only has access to the first eight
	registers. This means that the first eight windowed RAM are no
	longer packable. Therefore the RAM window can be moved to
	somewhere more sensible if necessary.


short literal:
  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 |_ _ _|_ _ _ _ _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
  0 1 1    dest      literal

	The short literal is now only 8bit. However the first 32 registers
	may be written to which is virtually all the special registers.
